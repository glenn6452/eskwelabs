# My Eskwelabs Capstone Project

### Week 3 (05/27): Question and Data Set(s)

**Descriptions:**

* I'm planning to predict whether a borrower(client) will be default on the 30 days past due & whether a new applicant should be approved or not. This can be credit scoring as well.
* I have loan applications datasets that contains demographic information of the borrowers.
* I know that my datasets have Zero to minimal null values, and don't require cleaning compare to the public datasets.
* I choose this topic because I'm interested on how Financial Inclusion would leverage Data Science to mitigate risk and protects companies portfolio.
